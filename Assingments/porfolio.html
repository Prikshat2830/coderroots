            <hr>
            <p>
                I am a passionate and self-driven Computer Science student with a keen interest in web development and creating effective web experiences. My main area of interest is in full stack development, where I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend of applications to develop comprehensive and user-centric applications. I am especially interested in developing contemporary, responsive, and optimized websites that deliver real value to users.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, I have built a good foundation in fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more contemporary frameworks such as React.js for developing dynamic and interactive user interfaces. On the backend, I use Node.js and Express.js to develop scalable server-side applications and RESTful APIs, and MongoDB for effective database management.
                <br><br>
                I have acquired hands-on experience in developing responsive websites, single-page applications, and full stack applications through academic, self-directed, and project-based learning.These have helped me better understand application architecture, state management, API connectivity, authentication, and database design. I am passionate about coding in a clean and maintainable way and adhering to best practices to ensure that my applications are scalable and easily improvable.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my technical skills, I possess excellent problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a learning attitude. I find it exciting to decompose complex problems into manageable pieces and look for efficient solutions. I am also a team player who appreciates effective communication and enjoys working in a setting where knowledge sharing and development are promoted.
                <br><br>
                I am always learning about new technologies and optimizing my development process to keep up with industry trends. My aim is to be part of real-world projects where I can leverage my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and develop into a very competent software developer. I am currently looking for internship or entry-level opportunities where I can contribute to a development team while continuing to develop my skills and expertise.
